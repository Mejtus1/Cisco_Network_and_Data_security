ICMP Protocol
- connectionless protocol that does not use any port number and works in the network layer
- ICMP was not designed to transfer data in the same way as TCP and UDP
- ICMP carries diagnostic messages and report error conditions 
- often associated with commands such as "ping" (ICMP echo request) or "traceroute" (ICMP TTL expired in transit)
- some administrators block ICMP to prevent attackers from gathering information about their internal network

ICMP Destination Host Unreachable     = host is unable to reach another host on the local network
ICMP Destination Network Unreachable  = network link is down
ICMP Host Administratively Prohibited = traffic is blocked by a firewall

ICMP Vulnerabilities
Reconnaissance and scanning: 
- ICMP can be used to launch information gathering attacks
- Attackers can use different methods within the ICMP to find out live host, network topology, and OS fingerprinting, and determine the state of a firewall

ICMP unreachables:
- commonly used by attackers to perform network reconnaissance. 
- network reconnaissance refers to the act of scanning the target network to gather information about the target
example: during a protocol or port scan, an ICMP Protocol Unreachable tells an attacker that a protocol is not in use on the target device
- an ICMP Port Unreachable tells the attacker that a port is not in use on the target device

ICMP mask reply: 
- allows the router to tell a requesting endpoint what the correct subnet mask is for a given network

ICMP redirects: 
- router sends an IP redirect to notify the sender of a better route to the destination
- intended purpose of this feature was for a router to send redirects to the hosts on its directly connected networks
- attacker use this feature to send an ICMP redirect message to the victim's host, luring the victim's host into sending all traffic through a router that is owned by the attacker. 
- ICMP redirect attack is an example of an MITM attack, where an attacker will act as the middle man for all communication from the source to the destination.

ICMP router discovery: 
- ICMP Router Discovery Protocol allows hosts to locate routers that can be used as a gateway to reach IP-based devices on other networks
- IRDP does not have any form of authentication, it is impossible for end hosts to tell whether the information they receive is valid or not
- attacker can perform an MITM attack using IRDP
- spoof the IRDP messages to add bad route entries into a victimâ€™s routing table, victims host will forward the packets to the wrong address/unable to reach other networks

Firewalk: 
- firewalking is an active reconnaissance technique that employs traceroute-like techniques to analyze IP packet responses to determine: 
the gateway 
ACL filters 
map out the networks
- firewalking technique works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL that is one greater than the targeted gateway
If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP Time Exceeded Message
If the gateway host does not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets and the attacker will see no response
