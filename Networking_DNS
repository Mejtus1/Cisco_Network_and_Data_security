DNS
- provides mappings between the hostnames and IP addresses, or other mappings
- can map hostnames, such as host.example.com, to IP address, such as 192.168.40.100 (or the IPv6 address)
- enables access to the network resources by their names instead of having to remember their IP addresses
- primarily uses UDP port 53 for DNS queries and responses
- DNS queries consist of a UDP request from the client followed by a UDP response from the DNS server
- TCP port 53 is used when the DNS response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or for tasks such as zone transfers
(Zone transfer is a type of DNS transaction. Zone transfer is used by the DNS administrators to replicate the DNS databases across a set of DNS servers.)

DNS Distributed Database
- globally distributed, scalable, hierarchical, and dynamic database
- no single DNS server on the Internet contains the entire DNS database
- authority over the different parts of the DNS database is delegated to different DNS servers in the Internet 
- DNS database is composed of a hierarchical domain name space that contains a tree-like data structure of linked domain names (nodes)

- each FQDN is composed of one or more labels. Labels are separated with a dot (.), and may contain a maximum of 63 characters
- FQDN may contain a maximum of 255 characters, including the dot (.)
- labels are constructed from right to left, where the label at the far right is the top-level domain (TLD) for the domain name
- .com is the TLD for http://www.cisco.com because it is the label furthest to the right
