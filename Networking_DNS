DNS
- provides mappings between the hostnames and IP addresses, or other mappings
- can map hostnames, such as host.example.com, to IP address, such as 192.168.40.100 (or the IPv6 address)
- enables access to the network resources by their names instead of having to remember their IP addresses
- primarily uses UDP port 53 for DNS queries and responses
- DNS queries consist of a UDP request from the client followed by a UDP response from the DNS server
- TCP port 53 is used when the DNS response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or for tasks such as zone transfers
(Zone transfer is a type of DNS transaction. Zone transfer is used by the DNS administrators to replicate the DNS databases across a set of DNS servers.)


------------------------
DNS Distributed Database
- globally distributed, scalable, hierarchical, and dynamic database
- no single DNS server on the Internet contains the entire DNS database
- authority over the different parts of the DNS database is delegated to different DNS servers in the Internet 
- DNS database is composed of a hierarchical domain name space that contains a tree-like data structure of linked domain names (nodes)

Diagram illustrates a sample of the DNS hierarchy starting from the root (.)
           :-- .arpa :--- in.addr
           :         :--- .ip6

- each FQDN is composed of one or more labels. Labels are separated with a dot (.), and may contain a maximum of 63 characters
- FQDN may contain a maximum of 255 characters, including the dot (.)
- labels are constructed from right to left, where the label at the far right is the top-level domain (TLD) for the domain name
- .com is the TLD for http://www.cisco.com because it is the label furthest to the right


------------
DNS Mappings
- DNS can perform various other types of mapping(than IPs to Hostnames), each mapping type is defined in a different type of resource record (RR)
(RR) A record = IPv4 DNS address record = maps a hostname to an IPv4 address 
(RR) MX record = domain name to a list of mail servers for that domain
(RR) NS record = name server for the domain
(RR) AAAA record = hostnames to the IPv6 address of the host
(RR) PTR record = "canonical name" = most common use implementing reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to the hostname
(RR) NS record = NS record identifies the DNS servers that are responsible (authoritative) for a zone
(RR) CNAME record = is used to specify that a domain name is an alias for another domain name, which is the "canonical" domain name
(RR) TXT record = associate any arbitrary text with a hostname, (only used in specific cases such as Domain Keys Identified Mail, used as a method to detect email spoofing)
(RR) SOA record = identifies the name server that is the best source of information for the data within the zone


Microsoft DNS server
- the domain name is secure-x.local, hq-srv.secure-x.local host is the name server for the secure-x.local domain, as configured by the NS record. 
- A records are used to map the hostname to the IP address, hq-srv hostname is mapped to the 192.168.1.2 IP address
- FQDM are hq-srv.secure-x.local and inside-srv.secure-x.local

nslookup UTILITY 
- available on Windows and Linux
- querying the DNS database for domain names, IP address mapping, or any specific DNS record

A record: 
Using the nslookup utility, it shows that the dmz.secure-x.public host that is resolved to the IP address of 192.0.2.50 from the 209.165.200.233 DNS server,
209.165.200.233 DNS server is not the authoritative DNS server for the secure-x.public domain

DNS Terminology

Resource record: 
- defines the DNS data types that are stored in the DNS database
- most common types of RRs: (Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail servers (MX), name servers (NS), 
pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME))
- an RR is composed of the following fields: NAME, TYPE, CLASS, TTL, RDLENGTH, and RDATA.

Stub DNS resolver:
- client device operating systems or applications use very simple stub DNS resolvers
- typically, stub DNS resolvers issue DNS queries to the DNS recursive resolversâ€”not only for DNS information about the internal resources, 
but also for DNS information about publicly registered domains.
DNS resolver
- client side of DNS is called a DNS resolver
- DNS resolver sending a DNS query to a DNS server requesting the information that is defined in an RR

DNS recursie resolver: 
- DNS server that processes the clients DNS queries
- DNS recursive server queries the necessary authoritative DNS servers for the RR information(DNS recursive server provides the 
answer back to the DNS client) 

Open DNS recursive resolvers:
- allow queries from all IP addresses and are exposed to the Internet
- public open DNS recursive resolvers include GoogleDNS (8.8.8.8) Cisco OpenDNS (208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220) 
- attackers use OPEN DNE recursive resolvers for amplification attacks 

Authoritative DNS server: 
- responsible for all the domains RRs
- provide authorithative responses to DNS recursive resolvers
- are exposed to the internet

DNS zones: 
- DNS is partitioned into DOMAINS nad ZONES
- zone is is a contiguous portion of the domain name space in the DNS for which the administrative responsibility has been delegated to a single manager
- zone is the authoritative source for information about each domain that is included in the zone
- zone file is a text file that describes a DNS zone, and contains a list of the zone's resource records

The following figure shows the DNS query/response flow between the stub DNS resolver, the DNS recursive resolver, and the authoritative DNS server.
         :----------------------------------:--------:---------------------------------------:
     DNS Client                        DNS Recursive Resolver                         Authoritative DNS server 
(Stub DNS resolver)
Client   :---------1. DNS query--------- > DNS Recursive -----------1. DNS query ------> Authoritative DNS 
Client   <---------2. DNS query--------- < DNS Non-Authoritative <----------2. DNS query ------< Authoritative DNS 
                                                  Response                                           Response    

============================================================================================================================================================
============================================================================================================================================================
DDNS = Dynamic DNS 
- allows the automated discovery and registration of the client system's public IP addresses
- DDNS client program on the end-user device in the private network connects to the DDNS provider's with a unique login name
- DDNS provider uses the name to link the discovered public IP address with a hostname in the domain name system
- mainly used in homes, allows to access devices in home from anywhere in the world even if IP address changes (home address can change)
- if IP address is changed DDNS will update IPs and map it to hostname automatically (myhomepc.ddns.org = 10.15.80.4, if IP changes DDNS updates it)
- DDNS provider maps a new subdomain (based on a list of existing domains that are owned by the DDNS provider) to the DDNS client's dynamic IP address 
that is currently provisioned by the ISP

-------------------
Recursive DNS Query
- DNS recursive resolver receives a DNS query for information for which it is not authoritative, it will recursively query the DNS architecture for the authoritative DNS server information
- once DNS recursive resolver has obtained the requested information from the authoritative DNS server, 
it will provide that information to the original DNS resolver using a DNS response message
- in this case, the resource record will be non-authoritative (since the recursive DNS resolver is not authoritative for the requested information)
- recursive DNS request requires more processing by the DNS server, when compared to a nonrecursive DNS request

- DNS recursive resolver may also have knowledge about the requested information that is stored in its local DNS cache.
- If requested information is present in the DNS cache, then recursive DNS resolver will respond with locally cached resource record information

- following figure illustrates the recursive DNS process (assuming that nothing has been cached in the DNS recursor local DNS cache yet):
1. DNS resolver (DNS client) sends a query message to the DNS recursor (DNS recursive resolver) asking for the address of www.cisco.com
2 DNS recursor sends a query message to the root name servers looking for the .com domain name space
3. root name servers send a DNS referral response message to the DNS recursor informing it to ask the generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) name 
servers for the .com domain name space
4. DNS recursor sends a query message to the gTLD name servers looking for the .cisco.com domain name space
5. gTLD name servers send a DNS referral response message to the DNS recursor informing it to ask the .cisco.com name servers, 
ns1.cisco.com or ns2.cisco.com, about this domain name space
6. DNS recursor sends a query to ns1.cisco.com or ns2.cisco.com, asking for www.cisco.com
7. .cisco.com name servers, ns1.cisco.com or ns2.cisco.com, send an authoritative DNS query response message to the DNS recursor with 
the A (address) RR information for www.cisco.com.
8. DNS recursor sends a DNS query response message to the DNS resolver with the A (address) RR information for www.cisco.com



--------------
DNS Tunneling
- DNS tunnel can be used for command and control, data exfiltration, or tunneling of any IP traffic
- DNS tunneling does not need to be stealthy, relying on the fact that DNS is often unmonitored. 

- to create a DNS tunnel, the attacker creates a DNS server that resolves a domain name created for the attack (acaerlxwsr.badguydomain.bad)
- DNS tunneling server will have a special logical interface configured via a DNS tunneling tool such as Iodine
- target system will also have a logical interface allowing it to tunnel IP traffic out to the Internet
- DNS tunneling server will be the authoritative name server for the domain that will be used, an Internet-accessible server that the attacker control 
- once set up, data communication is encoded by one of various methods and then placed as the payload of the DNS communications
- DNS tunneling uses the malicious server as the authoritative name server for the specific domain that is created for this attack
- tunnel is established between the infected client and the attacker controlled authoritative name server through the DNS resolver

- benefit of DNS tunneling is that, as mentioned, it is not often detected as DNS traffic is normal and expected on a network
- drawback is slow speed. Further, DNS tunneling does not usually allow for communication to be initiated from the server to the client 
(this traffic should be blocked by the firewall)

- examining payloads for unusual content, packet size, frequency of requests, 
- and looking for unusual hostnames are a few techniques to discover instances of DNS tunneling
