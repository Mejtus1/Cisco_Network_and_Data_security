NAT

- defined in RFC 1631
- operates in Layer 3 forwarding devices to provide address simplification and conservation
- connect networks using private RFC 1918 network addresses to the public Internet
- NAT translates the private addresses that are used in the internal network into public addresses that can be routed across the Internet
- use only one address for the entire network to the outside world thus effectively hides the internal network, thus providing additional security
- multiple device types can be configured to perform NAT services. Although firewalls are most common, routers and some Layer 3 switches are also capable of deploying this service

list of NAT terms:
Inside local address: - IPv4 address that is assigned to a host on the inside network (RFC 1918 reserved private IPv4 address spaces)
Inside global address: - globally routable IPv4 address that represents one or more inside local IPv4 addresses to the outside world
Outside local address: - IPv4 address of an outside host as it appears to the inside network (can be allocated from a routable address space)
Outside global address: - IPv4 address that is assigned to a host on the outside network by the host owner (globally routable address or network space)

benefits
- eliminates the need to readdress all hosts that require external access, saving time and money
- conserving IPv4 addresses = internal hosts can use same IPv4 non routable address and the distinction between them can be made throught ports

- firewall that is translating the source address as the packet is forwarded from inside to outside
- host 10.10.10.11 sends a packet to Host B
- router receives the packet and checks its NAT table. It finds an entry to translate 10.10.10.11 to 203.0.113.2.
if there was no entry in the table, the router would check the NAT rules to see if there is a rule specifying a dynamic translation
if there was such a rule, a new entry would be created
- router replaces the inside local address 10.10.10.11 with the inside global address 203.0.113.2 and forwards the packet
- host B receives the packet with 203.0.113.2 as the source address. When Host B replies, it specifies 203.0.113.2 as the destination address
- router receives the reply packet and checks its NAT table, it finds the entry that is associated with the inside global IPv4 address 203.0.113.2.
- router replaces the inside global address 203.0.113.2 with the inside local address 10.10.10.11 and forwards the packet
