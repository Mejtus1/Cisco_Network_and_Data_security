Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- to send data to a destination, a host on an Ethernet network must know the MAC address of the destination
- ARP provides the essential service of mapping IP addresses to physical addresses on a network
- MAC address is the unique identifier of the device (usually embedded in the hardware during manufacturing)
- also referred to as the hardware address or the physical address (48 bits long and is usually represented using hexadecimal notation)
- groups of digits are commonly separated with colons, dashes, or periods, following three example notations are common and equivalent: 
54:EE:75:B1:6F:22, 54-EE-75-B1-6F-22, and 54EE.75B1.6F22

Example:
When a system knows the IP address of its peer but does not know the MAC address, it sends an ARP request. 
The ARP request specifies the known IP address and is broadcast on the local network. 
The broadcast is received by all devices on the Ethernet segment. 
When the target recognizes its own IP address by reading the contents of the ARP request packet, it responds with the required MAC address in its ARP reply. 
The address resolution procedure is completed when the originator receives the reply packet (containing the required MAC address) from the target. 
The originator then updates the table containing all the current bindings. 
This table is called the ARP cache or ARP table. 
ARP cache is used to maintain a correlation between each IP address and its corresponding MAC address.
