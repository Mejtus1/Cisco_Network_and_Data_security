Attack Surface 
- total sum of all the vulnerabilities in a given computing device or network that is accessible to the attackers

- attack surface may be categorized into different areas:
software attack surfaces (open ports on a server) 
physical attack surfaces (USB ports on a laptop)
network attack surfaces (console ports on a router) 
human/social engineering attack surfaces (employees with access to sensitive information)

- smaller attack surface can help make the organization less exploitable, reducing the risk. 
- greater attack surface makes the organization more vulnerable to attacks, which increases the risk.

Attack surfaces can be divided in to the following four categories:


==========================================================================================================================================================================
Reconnaissance Attacks 

- reconnaissance = attempt to learn more about the intended victim before attempting a more intrusive attack
- goal = discover the following information about targeted computers or networks
1.IP addresses, sub-domains, and related information on a target network
2.Accessible UDP and TCP ports on target systems
3.The operating system on target systems

---------------------------------------------
Main subcategories for gathering network data
- Packet sniffers = capturing data that is passed over network, looking for useful information 
examples: Wireshark, Ettercap, NetworkMiner
- Ping sweeps = set of ICMP echo packets, determining which machines are alive to attack them later 
examples: fping command conducts ping sweeps 
- Port scans = checks host network for open ports
insecure protocols: 21(FTP), 23(Telnet), 110(POP3), 143(IMAP), 161(SNMP, SNMPv2)
examples: Nmap
- Information queries = resolve hostnames to IP / IP to hostname
examples: nslookup

-----
Whois
- gather public information about a target network from DNS registries

Shodan Search Engine
- help an attacker identify a specific device

---------------
Robots.txt File
- attacker can gather a lot of valuable information from a target's website
