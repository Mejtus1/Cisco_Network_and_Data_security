ACL
- access control lists (ACLs) provide a basic level of security for network access
- without any ACLs configured on a router, all packets pass through the router and onto the network

INTERNET------ROUTER-------------------------ROUTER2----- Reasearch and developemnt(PCs)
              (DMZ)                                :
                :                                  :
                :                                  Human resources(PCs)
     Web server / Mail server
- if PC from Human resources wanted to access Computer in Reasearch and development ACL prevents it

ACL Packet Filter 
- packet filters look at individual packets in isolation
- based on the contents of the packet and the configured policy, they decide to permit or deny packets from entering or exiting the router interface

(User Subnet)                                            (Server Subnet)
 10.1.1.0/24 -------------Gi0/1------QFP------------------10.10.10.0/24
                                   (Router)

following ACL applied to the gi0/1 interface:
access-list 100 permit tcp any 10.10.10.10 eq www
access-list 100 permit tcp any 10.10.10.10 eq 443
access-list 100 permit tcp any 10.10.10.11 eq www
access-list 100 permit tcp any 10.10.10.11 eq 443
access-list 100 permit tcp any 10.10.10.12 eq ftp
access-list 100 permit tcp any 10.10.10.12 eq ftp-data
access-list 100 deny ip any any log
!
interface gi0/1
ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
ip access-group 100 in
<output omitted>
- the ACL describes a policy of what is permitted and denied from the user subnet to the server subnet
1. Clients on the user subnet are permitted to send packets to TCP ports 80 and 443 on the web server
2. Clients on the user subnet are permitted to send packets to TCP ports 20 and 21 on the FTP server
3. There is an explicit deny for all other packets as the last entry in the ACL
- ip access-group command is then used to apply the access list to an interface

======================================================================================================================================================
ACLs with the Established Option
- stateless devices such as routers do not track the state of TCP connections

Network A ------------------- R1 ------- e0 ----------- Network B

access-list 102 permit tcp any any established
!
interface ethernet0
 ip access-group 102 in
!
- permits TCP packets from any source IP address to any destination IP address as long as either the TCP ACK bit or the TCP RST bit is set
- there are no ACL restrictions for packets originating from NetA
-  if a host on NetB attempts to initiate a TCP connection with a host on NetA, the first step of the three-way handshake is denied
- hosts on NetB cannot use ICMP echo to perform a ping scan of NetA, they can perform an ACK scan

======================================================================================================================================================
ACLs with the Established Option Example

(Trusted Subnet)                                (Untrusted Subnet)
 172.16.1.0/24 ---------------- R1 ------------- FTP Server / Attacker 

access-list extended PermitReturnTraffic 
  10 permit tcp any any established
  20 deny ip any any

- clients on the trusted network can establish the FTP control channel by connecting to TCP port 21 on the FTP server
- first packet, sent from the client to the server, only sets the SYN flag in the TCP header and it presents the clients initial sequence number
- the server then responds with a packet that has both the SYN bit and the ACK bit set
- the server presents its initial sequence number and it acknowledges the clients initial sequence number
- client then completes the three-way handshake with an ACK, acknowledging the serverâ€™s initial sequence number

- the ACL will not permit ping via ICMP echo requests
- Instead of sending an ICMP echo request, the attacker can send a TCP packet with the ACK bit set to a destination address
