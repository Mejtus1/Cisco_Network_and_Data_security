IP Protocol
- the IP is a connectionless protocol that is mainly used to route information across the Internet 
- IP depends on upper-level TCP/IP suite layers to provide accountability and reliability
- layers above IP use the source address in an incoming packet to identify the sender
- to communicate with the sender, the receiving station sends a reply by using the source address in the datagram
- IP makes no effort to validate whether the source address in the packet that is generated by a node is actually the source address of the node (address can be spoofed)

IP Vulnerabilities
Key IP address-based vulnerabilities that threaten network infrastructures:

Man-in-the-middle attack: 
- intercepts a communication between two systems
- device is inserted between running packets to intercept them, and forward them to original destination
- this attack is able to defeat sophisticated authentication mechanisms because of established session where its placed in middle of completed authentication 
- doesnt treat netowrk stability but its credibility
- Other for of MITM can be called evasdropping é perpetrator copies/intercepts IP packets not modify them 

Session hijacking: 
- MITM is continued practice of Session hijacking, after MITM attack the attacker hijacks the session 
- attacker can gain full access to destination PC by assuming idnetity of user 
- legitimate user would see login as successful them be cut off (reprated login would most likely result in error message = User alerady in use)

IP address spoofing: 
- attackers spoof the source IP address in an IP packet 
- IP spoofing can be used for several purposes 

DoS attack: 
- an attacker attempts to prevent legitimate users from accessing information,services or resources
- resources on target PC or Server are overwhelmed and cannot be used or accessed by legitimate users

DDoS attack: 
- DoS attack that features a simultaneous, coordinated attack from multiple source machines

Smurf attack: 
- exploits the IP broadcast addressing to create a DoS
Example using ICMP
One of the utilities that are embedded in ICMP is ping which is commonly used to test the availability of certain destinations. 
The attacker installs smurf on a hacked computer. 
The hacked machine starts continuously pinging one or more networks—with all their attached hosts—using IP broadcast addresses. 
Every host that receives the broadcast ping message is obliged to respond with its availability. 
The result is that the hacked machine gets overwhelmed with inbound ping responses.

Resource exhaustion attacks
- cause the server’s or network's resources to be consumed to the point where the service is no longer responding
